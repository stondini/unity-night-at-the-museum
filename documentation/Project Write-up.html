<h1>Introduction</h1>
<b>Night at the Museum</b> is a project of Udacity VR Developer nano-degree (term 2).<br/>
The museum visitor can walk to reach the viewing stations and activate the station's related content.<br/>
This write up presents the project achievement process that starts with Persona description, scene sketches &amp; ideas, sound &amp; light environment, user testing and deployment on a device.<br/>
The entire process was executed iteratively (agile methodology).
<br/><br/>
Goals of this write up :
<lu>
    <li>Museum description, ideas and scenarii to be sure the audience will understand all the concepts (sketches and screenshots of a beta version help to materialise).</li>
    <li>Tests feedback. They are useful to improve the experience.</li>
    <li>What are the next amazing steps likely to interest the audience.</li>
</lu>

<h1>Sketche and Ideas</h1>
The idea is to build a museum that gives informations on some famous Swiss Alps mountains.<br/>
The visitor can move around mountains using a way points navigation system.<br/>
Each mountain is identified by a <i>pinpoint</i> which is displaying the name and altitude of the related mountain.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<h2>Swiss Alps</h2>
The user can visit the must fabulous Swiss Alps Mountains my moving along a path (red line below).<br/><br/>
<img src="CameraPath.png" width="640px"/>

<h1>Design</h1>
<p>
The first think to do is to build the mesh of the Swiss Alps.<br/>
Swiss Government provides a 3D points cloud of the whole country (<a href="https://www.swisstopo.admin.ch">Swiss Topo</a>).<br/>
The points cloud must be converted to a mesh (<i>I tried few apps like CloudCompare, MeshLab and Blender. I finally used Blender</i>).
The useless points outside the Alps area are removed.
</p>
<p>
The second step is to map the texture on the mesh (<i>This took me a lot of time because it was the first time I used Blender app</i>).
</p>
<img src="BlenderMesh.png" width="640px"/>
<p>
Next, the mesh and its texture are exported from Blender and imported into Unity.<br/>
Pinpoints are placed on the top of interesting mountains (<i>I used Google Map to locate the position of the mountains as precisely as possible.</i>).
</p>
<p>
Wayspoints are positionned to allow the visitor reaching all interesting mountains.
</p>
<p>
Last step is to code all the glue :
<ul>
    <li>Application controller that initialize the pinpoints and the camera.</li>
    <li>Waypoints navigation. This could be the same code as <i>A Maze</i> project.</li>
    <li>UI interactions.</li>
    <li>UI WebView to display the Wikipedia page of the selected mountains.</li>
    <li>Video clips.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h1>Scene</h1>
Each important mountain is pointed by a <i>pinpoint</i>.
<lu>
    <li>A <i>pinpoint</i> shows a mountain name and altitude.</li>
    <li>The user can <i>click</i> on a <i>pinpoint</i> to display the <b>Wikipedia</b> description on a giant virtual screen.</li>
    <li>The <i>pinpoints</i> must be always visible to the user. It means, the <i>pinpoints</i> must <i>look at</i> or <i>facing </i>the user/camera at any time.</li>
    <li>The cloudy skybox improve the scene's reality.</li>
    <li>The sound of a windy weather improve the scene's reality</li>
    <li>The UI canvas contains few toggle buttons to allow way point altitude change.</li>
</lu>

<h2>Testing the Scene</h2>
<p>
The first test is related to the <i>pinpoint</i> that shows a mountain place.<br/>
The goal of this test is to gather information about the visibility and the understanding of the concept of <i>pinpoint</i>.
</p>
<img src="2018-04-30-Pin.Draft.png" width="640px" /><br/><br/>
<p>
The first impression if the tester was <i>Ouhahou ! It's amazing !</i><br/>
The pinpoints are too big comparing to the map and the mountains. They mask some mountains.<br/>
</p>

I asked few questions:
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Question</th>
    <th>Answer</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>How big you think you are in this experience ?</td>
    <td>I feel far from the mountains. The mountains appears small.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Can you describe the mood / atmosphere ?</td>
    <td>I feel like a bird.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Is there anything that you’d like to look at but that’s difficult to see ?</td>
    <td>The name of the mountain appears a little blurry. It should be centered according to the green pinpoint.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Tell me about your experience ?  </td>
    <td>It was a great immersive experience.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Did you enjoy the experience (yes / no) ?</td>
    <td>Yes</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>
The tester liked it. He had a flying bird impression (<i>this remarks gave me the idea to add a flying bird song</i>).<br/>
The tester said he has the impression of "falling down" when he navigates near the borders of the map.<br/>
</p>

<h1> GUI - User Testing </h1>
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Question</th>
    <th>Answer</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Do you see a panel in front of you ?</td>
    <td>Yes, I understand I'm at the museum.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What do you think the panel is for ?</td>
    <td>It presents three buttons. I can change the altitude of the waypoints.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<h2>Movement - User Testing </h2>
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Question</th>
    <th>Answer</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>How did you feel about the speed of the movementy (too slow, too fast) ?</td>
    <td>Some are slow, some are fast (<i>I explained the travel time is the same between two waypoints</i>).</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Did you feel sick or uncomfortable ?</td>
    <td>No. Except near the boarders of the scene.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Did you notice any sort of height changes or anything disorienting in the movement ? </td>
    <td>No, but in some cases, I flew through the waypoint (<i>This is due to the waypoint redisplay when the reticle is out of the collider</i>).</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<h2>Audio and Visual Feedback - User Testing</h2>
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Question</th>
    <th>Answer</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Did you like the audio and visual feedback ?</td>
    <td>Yes, the wind sound and the flying bird sound are nice. But one more time, I didn't like the borders of the map.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<h1>User Testing Results</h1>
Hereafter the changes I made according to the testing phases :
<ul>
<li>Reducing the size of the pinpoints.</li>
<li>Increasing the time of travel between waypoints.</li>
<li>Adding the flying bird sound.</li>
<li>NOT YET IMPLEMENTED (see Next Steps) : Changing the skybox to define more smooth borders.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Breakdown of final project</h1>
Below, few screenshots of the final project.

<img src="2018-05-05-Breakdown-4.png" width="640px" /><br/><br/>

<h1>Next Steps</h1>
<p>
I'd like to build a more precise mesh using more points.<br/>
The purpose is to provide many more mountains with a very high resolution texture. Maybe many textures should be used. One by mesh part.
</p>
<p>
Visitor experience could be improved by letting it navigate freely.<br/>
Waypoints will be removed and replaced by a navigation system that requires specific hardware like hand controllers.<br/>
The skybox should be reviewed to avoid the sharp borders. This will avoid the visitor remark <i>Ha ! I'm going to fall....</i>
</p>
<p>
The WebView is not good. Maybe I should consider a commercial WebView. I could also check if the last Unity version provides a WebView.
</p>
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>
<b>Night at the Museum</b> VR project was ambishious.<br/>
It was interesting because I played few other roles than VR Developer.<br/>
It was also challenging because of the next points.<br/>
</p>
Some points in the project was tough to implement or causing issues:
<ol>
    <li>Using Blender App to create the mesh and map the texture. Blender is not a simple app. I read few tutorials to achieve the mesh and texture mapping.</li>
    <li>Finding and using a WebView. Unity doesn't provide a builtin WebView so I found one.<br/>The result is not perfect because the view is not fully integrated in to the canvas or the scene.</li>
    <li>I made the video clips using iMovie and exported them in MP4 format (720p). But Unity video player renders the clips with a poor quality (there a lot of issues <a href="https://forum.unity.com/threads/video-player-some-mp4-working-some-not.464665/">here</a>). So, I used Handbrake to re-encode the video clips using <b>Web Optimization</b>.</li>
    <li>A lack of time to implement a better result. Two weeks is too short.</li>
</ol>
<p>
I'm not fully statified by the result. Navigation is not perfect. I thing the visitor should <i>fly</i> instead of moving by waypoints.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, I enjoyed designing and implementing this project.
